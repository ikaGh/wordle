JavaScript Code:

1. Variable Declarations:
height and width define the dimensions of the game board.
row and col are used to track the current position on the board.
gameOver is a boolean flag to indicate whether the game has ended.
guessList seems to be an array used to store guessed words.
wordList seems to be an array containing words for the game.
2. Initialization:
The window.onload event handler calls the initialize() function when the window has loaded.
The initialize() function sets up the game board and the keyboard.
3. Setting Up the Game Board:
Nested loops iterate over each cell of the game board and create a span element with an ID representing its position.
These span elements are appended to the HTML element with the ID "board".
4. Creating the Keyboard:
A nested loop generates the keys for the keyboard, creating div elements for each key.
Event listeners are added to the key divs to handle clicks.
Special handling is provided for the "Enter" and "Backspace" keys.
5. Handling Input:
The processKey() function is called when a keyboard key is pressed. It simulates an event object with the key code and calls processInput() with that event object.
The processInput() function handles the key press events.
If a letter key is pressed, it updates the corresponding cell on the game board.
If the "Backspace" key is pressed, it moves the cursor back one position.
If the "Enter" key is pressed, it triggers the update() function.
6. Updating the Game State:
The update() function is called when the "Enter" key is pressed.
It constructs a guess by collecting letters from the current row of the game board.
It checks if the guess is valid (exists in the guessList array).
It compares the guess with the target word, marking correct letters and indicating present or absent letters.
It updates the game state variables (row, col, gameOver) accordingly.
7. Displaying Results:
If the maximum number of guesses (height) is reached, the game ends and the correct word is displayed.
// Overall, this code implements a simple word guessing game interface where the player enters guesses via a virtual keyboard, and the correctness of the guesses is visually indicated on the game board.

HTML code:

1. HTML Structure:
The file starts with the HTML declaration (<!DOCTYPE html>).
Within the <head> section, there's a title for the webpage set to "Wordle".
Meta tags are present to specify the character encoding and viewport settings.
The <link> tag links an external CSS file named "wordle.css" to style the webpage.
The <script> tag links an external JavaScript file named "wordle.js" to provide functionality to the webpage.
2. Body Content:
Inside the <body> section, there's an <h1> element with the ID "title", displaying the title of the game, "Wordle".
A horizontal line <hr> is added for visual separation.
A <div> element with the ID "board" is provided to hold the game board. This is where the game board will be dynamically generated by the JavaScript code.
A line break <br> is included for spacing.
Another <h1> element with the ID "answer" is present. This element will display the result of the game, such as the correct word when the game ends.
3. External Files:
The CSS file "wordle.css" is expected to contain styles to visually format the webpage elements, including the game board.
The JavaScript file "wordle.js" is expected to contain the logic to initialize the game, handle user input, update the game state, and display results.


//Overall, this HTML file provides the structure for the Wordle game interface, linking to external CSS and JavaScript files for styling and functionality, respectively. The game board and result display elements are defined within the body of the HTML document, with dynamic content and behavior handled by the associated JavaScript code.
